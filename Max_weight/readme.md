# 0-1 Knapsack Problem Solver (Maximum Weight)

<p align="center">

This program solves the 0-1 Knapsack Problem using a naive recursive implementation. It calculates the maximum value that can be put into a knapsack of a given capacity, considering the values and weights of a set of objects.

## Pre-Requisites

- Python 3.x

</p>

## Input
The user should enter the data in incrreasing order of the weight.

 <a href="#lets-start ">Back to top</a>
</p>

## Description

The program allows the user to input the number of objects and their corresponding weights and values. It then prompts the user to enter the maximum weight to consider. The program calculates the maximum value that can be achieved by selecting objects in such a way that their total weight does not exceed the maximum weight.

The output includes:
- Number of objects considered
- Maximum weight considered
- Maximum value achieved
- List of objects included (in order), along with their weights and values
- Table showing the objects, their weights, and values
